# Dictionary
This Python program is a simple Engineering Dictionary that allows users to store and search for engineering terms and their definitions. It saves terms in a list and displays definitions when searched. If a term isn’t found, the user is notified. It’s a basic but useful tool for organizing and retrieving engineering concepts.
